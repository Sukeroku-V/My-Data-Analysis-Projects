Back to the grind!

Tableau is a work of art, really. Mastering it is probably the hardest yet most fullfiling task in Data Analysis, and I hope to do that.

IN this project, I made a sales dashboard that gives a comprehensive overview of sales performance in 2023, including total sales, sales trends, and a breakdown by subcategories. 

-The dashboard indicates that sales have decreased by up to -15.88% in some periods and increased by as much as 148.70% compared to the previous year. This suggests significant fluctuations in sales performance across the months.

-The categories with the highest sales include Chairs, Phones, and Tables. These are well above other categories, indicating strong demand or effective sales strategies in these areas While asteners, Labels, and Supplies have the lowest sales, distinguishing categories that perform above and below the average.

-Sales exhibit fluctuations throughout the weeks, with certain weeks showing peaks that reach above the average weekly sales ($3.16M), particularly in weeks 35-45.


Conclusion:

-The 2023 sales dashboard highlights strong performance in high-demand categories like Chairs, Phones, and Tables, which drive much of the yearâ€™s revenue. Conversely, subcategories like Fasteners and Labels underperform, suggesting potential areas for targeted improvements or promotional efforts.

Weekly sales trends reveal significant peaks in the latter half of the year, driven by seasonal demand, but fluctuating performance indicates room for a more consistent sales strategy. By focusing on stabilizing weaker periods and enhancing already successful categories, the company could build a more balanced and profitable sales trajectory moving forward.
