In this Dashboard, I tried to find ways to optimize the attention to Esports by different People based on earlier earnings.

Insights:

1. Dota 2 is the most successful games on and off-line.

2. Rocket League is the only top earning game that most of its success was build on online earnings.

3. First Person Shooter is the most popular genre in esports, as well as the most interactive one alongside Strategy Games based on the number of tournaments.

Promote First Shooter and Strategy Games and try to make more multiplayer Online Battle Arena tournaments to make the high number of its players more interested in the genre. Make more games like Dota, If there is already, Give them your full support and in the end, add more features to rocket league offline to make it more flexible and thus more successful.
