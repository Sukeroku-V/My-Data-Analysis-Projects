Using Python, I was able to extract important insights out of the goodreads dataset after displaying distribution graphs:

1. Brothers Karamazov is the highest rated book (do not agree if you care)

2. Twilight is the most famous book followed by the catcher is the rye(discmofort then comfort book)

3. English is the most commonly used language

4. Vintage & Penguins Productions are the top publishers.


Then with the help of Tableau, I created a dashboard to show the result.


Conclusion:

My taste is superior than the average taste.
