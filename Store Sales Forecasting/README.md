Full excel project for forecasting the amount of profit for the sales of furniture in a company.
1.Cleaning the data:
I removed the duplicates, other than that, it was a very clean data.
2.Processing the Data:
As an information, Profit=(Quantity×Price per Unit×(1−Discount))−Total Costs. and the "total costs" column was missing, so I added it using this simple equation: Total Costs=Sales−Profit, because Profit=Sales−Total Costs
3.Analyzing the data:
To do that, we need to ask questions, here, although there are so so many columns, the questions are obvious, and So are their answers:
-What do we need to improve the sales?
How can we do it?
