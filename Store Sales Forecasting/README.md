Full excel project for forecasting the amount of profit for the sales of furniture in a company.

1.Cleaning the data:

I removed the duplicates, other than that, it was a very clean data.

2.Processing the Data:

As an information, Profit=(Quantity×Price per Unit×(1−Discount))−Total Costs. and the "total costs" column was missing, so I added it using this simple equation: Total Costs=Sales−Profit, because Profit=Sales−Total Costs

3.Analyzing the data:

To do that, we need to ask questions, here, although there are so so many columns, the questions are obvious, and So are their answers:

-What do we need to improve the sales?

How can we do it?

In order to do that we need to ask specific questions:

-What is the ship modes that is used the most? the Standard One.

-What is its Relation with the total costs? when the ship mode is not of high class, it will cost the company.

-What is the most demanded Furniture? Furnishings by 45%

-What are the top 10 most demanded Products?

-which cities should the company target? Better show the Top 10 


4.Conclusion:

-Furnishings are the most demanded furniture followed by chairs, so in order to make the most out of them, the company needs to sell the best of them (like the "Hon Deluxe") and Deliver them to Big cities like New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia at the same day of the order to prevent more total costs and make an ultimate profit by the end of each sale.
