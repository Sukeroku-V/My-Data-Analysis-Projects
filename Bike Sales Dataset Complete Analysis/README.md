Our goal here is to analyze a bike sales dataset to optimize the sales for a certain company.

To do that, I used SQL to extract the infos I need then present the results in a beautiful dashboard using Power BI

1.SQL:

-December is the highest earning month overall.

-Adults bring the most money to the company.

-Men tend to buy bikes more than Women.

-The United States customers are the most.

-Bikes bring much more money to the table than the accessoires or/and clothing.

-Road Bikes are the highest earning type of bikes.

-Customers Prefer the ROAD_150 RED.

-The women mountains shorts cause additional, unnecessary cost.

2. Power BI:

With the information in hand, I created a dashboard combining categories with sub-categories, monthly with yearly profit and the targeted group for each gender.

3.Conclusion:

-Focus on selling Road Bikes(especially red ones) and get rid of any unnecessary clothing brands such as shorts. Target Men Adults living in the United States and make special services on summer vacations, especially in July to reach the same level of December's Success.
