the sales and profit of the company are increasing and so the amount of products they provide, but the profit margin didn't change a lot, how can we improve that?

Well, knowing that:

-the sales are increasing more than the profit

-Technology is the category that bring the more sales but furniture brings more profit

-Phones and Chairs are the most demanded items

-Arkansas and New York have the most customers


We can optimize our profit margin by focusing on selling tech and furniture products, especially phones and chairs, targeting New York and Arkansas above all other cities.
