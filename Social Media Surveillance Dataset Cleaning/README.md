I cleaned a messy dataset following these steps:

1.Loaded the dataset

2.Inspected the Data

3.Handled Missing Data and replaced them

4.Removed Duplicates

5.Fixed numeric Data types

6.Handled outliers in the volume column and displayed it with a boxchart

7.Corrected inconsistent data, especially differnet spellings

8.Droped additional, useless columns

9.Made it ready to save
