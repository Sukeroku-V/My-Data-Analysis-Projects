I created A dashboard to study supermarket sales, what affect them, the satisfaction of customers and time relation with sales.

Insights:

-Naypyitaw is the highest earning city by a small margin.

-Health and beauty products are the highest earning for males & food/beverages for females (That's surprising)

-Members are more satisfied than normal customers (that's not surprising)

-the sales are better in February

-the sales are better at 7AM


Conclusion:

- Plan Marketing campaigns especially in Naypyitaw and focus on health products for males and food for females, add features to the membership without neglecting normal service, be ready at 7 AM for an overload in service.
