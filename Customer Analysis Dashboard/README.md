I created this dashboard to dentify different customer segments based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics,  develop targeted marketing strategies for different customer segments and help to create a loyalty program for the best customers.

So, for the details. We need to answer these questions:

1.Which Gender should the company target the most?

2.Who are the most wealthy customers that can afford the best prooducts easily?

3.Which Category Attracts the customers the most?

4.Who are the most loyal customers?

To answer these questions, I created this dashboard and came up with these insights;

1. Men customers are more than females but just by a small margin.

2. Customer 888, 946, 580, 363 are the richest.

3. Electronics is the most preferred category of products. Clothing last.

4. There are 17 customers with 100 rate fro loyalty, customer 708 and 492 are who purchase the most among them.


Conclusion:

Sell more SPorts Products to men and more Home and Gardening products to women. Target the richest customers and make a loyalty program for those 17 customers with 100 spending score
