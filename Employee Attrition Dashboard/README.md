I created a dashboard that counterfeits the attrition rates in a company.

So, after creating an overview on the data that I have in the excel file, I tried to solve these questions;

1.How bad are the attrition rates in the company?

2.Why does the attrition happen?

3.What can we do about it?



In order to solve them, I created the charts one by one to reach a conclusion;

The attrition is more likely to happen to Adolescent males with low satisfaction rates in their buisness (especially the research directors), and while 17.10% of employees are lost, the company needs to replace them and provide better working conditions especially for research and sales experts.
