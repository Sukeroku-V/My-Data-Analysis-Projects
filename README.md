# My-Data-Analysis-Projects
I will show here every Data Analytics Project I've done using one or various tools.

Growing up, I've always been fond of numbers and statistics but what I didn't know back then was how some people use them incorrectly (whether on purpose or not). And when I had that idea for the first time, it made me sick, it still does, actually. But it's a thing to watch a thing from afar, to laugh at it, choose to believe it or not and to go deep down into the rabbit hole, doing what you love, passing boldly to the other side by the ashes of some hope, some dream, some attempt to achieve something.

With that being said, I have hated numbers and stats and I have loved them...amd I hope I'll make them right.
