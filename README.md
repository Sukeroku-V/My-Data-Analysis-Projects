# My-Data-Analysis-Projects
I will show here every Data Analytics Project I've done using one or various tools.

Growing up, I've always been fond of Art-related...I used to binge-watch/read everything that had any relation with art, I found myself in those books, those photographs, those silly little designs. They were and still my other world, the place I can always go to and be welcomed at any time.

Then in my first year of college, I've started to enjoy science, I mean real science, you know stuff like neurology, quantum mechanics, and god forbid not..Thermodynamics. The numbers, the facts, the reality I used to hate so much, to escape whenever I can never looked more beautiful to me, and it wasn't because of college. Funnily enough, It was because I was escaping again and found myself in a little dark, very beautiful side of internet knowledge and I've been hooked with what I used to hate so much. In other words, it wasn't until I started reading and found books they wouldn't let us read in school that I discovered you could be insane and happy and have a good life without being like everybody else. the numbers, the quatrillions whatever that is, The ton of knowledge that I can never grasp all of it but I can try, it was beautiful, it was full of...art?

Probably not that much, I guess.

So then I started a mini search to find a mix between what I like the most now, Art and Science and I couldn't find better than Data Analytics...the process of telling a story using some data, using big data, using bloody excel data. 


And it was only then when I had that idea for the first time, that I can become really goood at it. it brought some pale fire to me, the one I can hold into,it made me feel alive again. But then reality hit me like it usually does(by reality I mean SQL Tutorials). I sucked at it. It made me sick Other people also suck at it as I've seen, unable to tell a story but still found some success somehow in the field. I don't want that kind of success. What kind of good will it do? and so I know very well that it's a thing to watch from afar, to laugh , choose to believe data or not and to go deep down into the rabbit hole, doing what you love, passing boldly to the other side by the ashes of some hope, some dream, some attempt to achieve something, to not believe data but turn it into something meaningful, something you could direct people with into a better direction, a more noble one, hopefully.

With that being said, I have hated the numbers and I have loved them...and I hope I'll make them right.
