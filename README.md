# My-Data-Analysis-Projects

Growing up, I was always fond of art. I used to binge-watch and read anything remotely related to it—I found myself in those books, photographs, and those silly little designs. They were, and still are, my other world, the place I could always retreat to, where I felt welcomed anytime.

Then, in my first year of college, I began to enjoy science. Real science, like neurology, quantum mechanics, and, god forbid, not thermodynamics. The numbers, the facts, the reality I once despised and constantly sought to escape now seemed beautiful to me. And it wasn’t because of college. Ironically, it was because I was escaping again—this time into a fascinating, obscure corner of internet knowledge. I became hooked on what I once hated.

It wasn't until I began reading books they wouldn’t let us touch in school that I realized you could be both insane and happy, and still lead a good life without being like everybody else. The numbers—the quadrillions, or whatever they are—the endless ocean of knowledge I could never fully grasp but could always try... it was beautiful. It was full of art.

Maybe not in the traditional sense, but still.

So I began a mini-search for a blend of what I loved most now—art and science—and I couldn’t find a better fit than data analytics: the process of telling a story through data, whether big data or just simple Excel files.

And when I first realized this, I thought, "I can be really good at this." It sparked a pale fire in me, one I could hold onto. It made me feel alive again. But then, reality hit me hard, as it usually does (by reality, I mean SQL tutorials). I wasn’t good at it. It made me sick. I saw others struggle with it too, yet somehow, they found success in the field without truly mastering the craft. But that’s not the kind of success I want. What good would it do?

I know that it's something to watch from a distance—to laugh, to choose whether to believe the data or not. and to dive into the rabbit hole, doing what I love, passing Boldly into the other side by the ashes of that wasteful dream; to turn the data into something meaningful, something that guides people in a better, nobler direction—hopefully.

With that being said, I have hated numbers, and I have loved them. And I hope I'll make them right.
