In this project, I created a dashboard using a loan dataset from kaggle.
First, I created an overview for the stats shown in the table, then tried to solve the most important questions, which are:
What is the Approval rate?
What are the factors that control it?

Then, to solve them, I followed the following steps;
1. I created a pie chart to display the approval rate (73.77% of loan applications are approved while 26.23% are denied)
2. I created a clustered bar chart to show the relation between Group Ages and the approval rate (the Old people are always accepted, while 60% of young people are accepted and the rest denied)
4. for the next factor which is credit score, I showed the average, min and max values of it in a single chart to show how crucial having a high credit score is for the approval.

In conclusion:
This analysis indicates that older borrowers and those with higher credit scores are more likely to get approved, while younger borrowers or those with lower credit scores face higher rejection rates. â€‹
