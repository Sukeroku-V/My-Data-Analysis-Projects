This project was made to optimize the sales, and thus the revenue of a restaurant using SQL then Tableau

1.SQL:

-I cleaned the data removing blank rows then started to analyze the data, and came up with these insights;

-Sales are high during the first 4 months of the year, especially Frankie and Sandwiches.

-Customers prefer sandwiches and Frankie for fast food, cold coffee and sugarcane drinks for beverages.

-Customers pay more using Cash than Online methods

-Males tend to Sandwiches while females to Frankie, and both highly admire Cold coffees and sugarcane  drinks

-The revenue is at its peak during the night.

-Different Items are popular during different times of the day, to further explain:

Night: Sandwiches and Frankie

Afternoon: Basically drinks (cold coffees and sugarcane drinks)

Evening: Sandwiches and Frankie

Morning: Sandwiches and cold coffees

Midnight: Sandwiches and Frankie.

2. Then I took all that information to create a beautiful Dashboard Using Tableau, showing all the results of previous queries.


3.Conclusion:

Focus on selling Sandwitches to nakes and Frankies to females, always provide cold coffee with them. Provide more onlune payment methods and make special offers for different seasons of the year to achieve the same level of success of the first 4 months of the year
