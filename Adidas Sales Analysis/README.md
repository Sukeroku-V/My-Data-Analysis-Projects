I created a Power BI dashboard to analyze the sales of Adidas in the USA and came up with these insights:

-Adidas has an almost 900M total sales and an average price of 45 dollars per item.

-July is the most profitable month for the cmpany

-It is highly successful on th whole country but especially in the west

-Men's street Footwear and Women's Apparel are the most demanded products

-The west gear is the best retailer.


As a conclusion:

-To optimize sales, Adidas should focus on boosting July promotions and ensuring ample stock of Men’s Street Footwear and Women’s Apparel, especially in the western region with retailer West Gear. Prioritizing these key areas will maximize revenue and capitalize on peak demand.
