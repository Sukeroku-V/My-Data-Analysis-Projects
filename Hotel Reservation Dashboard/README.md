After creating an overview on a Hotel Reservation Dataset, I created this dashboard and came up with some insights:

1. Room Type 6 is the most wanted

2. Meal plan 1 is the most demanded

3. Lead times are either very low or high.

4. Average price per rooms are often more than 150 Dollars.

5. Most bookings are not canceled.


Conclusion:

To Reduce the bookings cancelation rate, we must reduce lead times as much as possible and the average price per room. At the same time we need rooms type 6 and Meal plan 1 to be always available
