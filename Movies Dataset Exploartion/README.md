Some Insights;

1.Comedy And Dramas are the most loved genres

2.Documentaries are a hit or miss(they are both in the top and bottom rating wise)

3.The Longest Movies are not successful at all, wether based on rating or votes

4.Good Adventure and Sci-fi movies need good advertisment to not end up as just "hidden gems", but succeed as they should in the box office

Conclusion:

Make a Drama, Comedy Or mix them with a biography to make a movie that is no longer than 300 min, advertise it and you got yourselves a box office.

N.B; a further study needs to be done on the success of 1972's movies
